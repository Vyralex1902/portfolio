            It all started in <span className="text-blue-500">January 2016</span> when I was 9 years old. I began to develop an interest in coding. Initially, I watched YouTube videos about programming and coding. Since my English skills were quite poor, I primarily watched Italian videos. These videos provided me with a general overview of what coding was and the challenges involved in learning it. At first, I thought, <span className="text-green-500">"Okay, this seems difficult. I'll just start another day.”</span><br /><br />

            At the <span className="text-blue-500">age of 13</span>, I began learning my first programming language: <span className="text-yellow-400">VB.NET</span>. After grasping the basics of this language, I decided to enhance my skills by learning <span className="text-yellow-400">C#</span>, a more advanced high-level programming language primarily used for creating applications with the Microsoft .NET Framework. I dedicated about four years to learning and practicing <span className="text-yellow-400">C#</span> before expanding my skill set with additional programming languages. I knew from the start that programming would be my future career.<br /><br />

            I have always been passionate about technology, especially software. For me, programming is the next level of loving tech because it involves creating it. While it's not hardware, software is crucial for any smart technology. Being a programmer opens up countless opportunities, from full-stack web development to PLC programming. The limitless possibilities are one of the things I love most about programming.<br /><br />

Later, I also learned <span className="text-yellow-400">TypeScript</span>, <span className="text-yellow-400">HTML</span> and <span className="text-yellow-400">CSS</span>, and decided that front-end web development would be my primary focus when searching for a job.

I’ll then also get a Master's degree and begin searching for a job.

            <br /><br />Anyway, for some time now, I've been fascinated by the idea that you can do anything if you focus on one thing at a time. I also love the saying that to be more productive, you need to split your problems into more, but smaller, problems. However, I haven't been able to apply these techniques yet. I think that if I did apply them, I would almost <span className="text-red-500">2x</span> my current productivity, maybe even more. Yet, I've found it difficult to apply them because I'm almost always out of ideas. That is pretty much the main reason why I am trying to be a freelancer as a side hustle. If somebody gives me a task to complete and provides me with ideas, I would be more determined and ready to complete them. So, if you are a company or an individual interested in hiring a frontend or app developer, I'm here.

            <br /><br />
            My whole learning process was 90% based on practice.
            I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, because I feel like it's a very personal decision to go for a practice- or theory-based learning process. So, if you would like to start coding just do what you feel, or even try both. Most of the time, the best is found in the middle.
            The most important advice tho, in my opinion, is to not code for too long in one go. Try to distribute the work time, otherwise you will get overwhelmed and learning will become much more difficult.
